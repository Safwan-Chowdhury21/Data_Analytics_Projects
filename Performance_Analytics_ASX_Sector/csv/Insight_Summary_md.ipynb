        "his suggests a high-risk/low-reward dynamic over the period, likely driven by market sensitivity and growth stock pullbacks.\n",
        "Investors seeking exposure in this sector would need a strong risk appetite and a long-term horizon.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, sectors like Finance and Retail demonstrated better return-to-risk ratios, combining moderate volatility with solid average returns.\n",

        "\n",
        "The correlation heatmap reveals distinct patterns of intra-sector cohesion and inter-sector divergence,\n",
        " offering key insights into diversification strategy and sector behavior within the ASX portfolio.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Strong Intra-Sector Correlations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Mining stocks (BHP.AX, RIO.AX, FMG.AX) exhibit high positive correlations (≥ 0.64),\n",
        "indicating strong co-movement driven by shared commodity exposure and macroeconomic sensitivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finance stocks (CBA.AX, NAB.AX, WBC.AX, ANZ.AX) also show tight correlation clusters (≥ 0.73),\n",
        "reflecting the synchronized movement of major banks under domestic rate cycles and credit conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Low or Negative Correlation Assets:\n",
        "\n",
        "Healthcare stocks, especially RMD.AX, CSL.AX, and SHL.AX, show weak correlations (close to 0 or negative) with mining and retail sectors,\n",
        "suggesting potential hedging value in portfolio construction.\n",
        "APX.AX (Technology) demonstrates the lowest average correlation across the board,\n",
        "reinforcing its role as a highly idiosyncratic, speculative asset with limited systemic exposure.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Portfolio Construction Implications\n",
        "\n",
        "  1.Clustering stocks from highly correlated sectors (e.g., Mining or Banking) offers limited diversification — a drawdown in one is likely mirrored across the group.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2.Cross-sector diversification (e.g., pairing FMG.AX with CSL.AX or WOW.AX) reduces overall portfolio volatility and increases resilience to sector-specific shocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3.Investors may leverage low-correlated assets like CSL.AX or RMD.AX to balance portfolios tilted toward high-beta sectors like Technology or Resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. High volatility doesn’t equal high return: The Technology sector had the highest volatility but lowest returns,\n",
        "  highlighting the risk of equating price swings with opportunity.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2.Intra-sector stocks move together: Mining (BHP.AX, RIO.AX, FMG.AX) and Finance (NAB.AX, WBC.AX, CBA.AX, ANZ.AX) showed strong internal correlation,\n",
        "  meaning they’re driven by similar macro forces — useful for trend amplification, risky for diversification.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3.Healthcare offers diversification benefits: Stocks like CSL.AX, RMD.AX, and SHL.AX showed low correlation with other sectors, making them ideal for balancing a portfolio.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4.Retail outperformed with lower volatility: JBH.AX and WES.AX delivered strong returns with moderate risk — a solid combo for medium-risk investors.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5.Stock selection within sectors matters: While Finance performed well overall, CBA.AX underperformed, proving that not all giants guarantee returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6.Data-driven analysis > gut feeling: This approach uncovered non-obvious truths (e.g., APX.AX being the most volatile and least correlated),\n",
        "  reinforcing the value of building portfolios using quantitative methods.\n",
